                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>Throughout my life, I've picked up many hobbies and interests. My number 1 hobby has always been gaming though. I played my first game around the age of 3, when my brother taught me how to play Call of Duty on our Playstation 2. I also like to dance, rap, and do lots of different types of puzzles. My most notable feats in terms of puzzles are my solves of the 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 Rubik's Cubes. I also like to make videos occasionally for TikTok and YouTube. That one is more of a side hobby when I get really bored, but a hobby is a hobby in my eyes.</p>
