                <h2>A little background</h2>
                <p>Hi! My name is Zacariah, but my friends like to call me Zac or Tecca. The name Tecca comes from the name of a rapper people like to say I look similar to. I was born in Riverside California on July 6th, 2007 (16 years old), and was raised around the area until I was around 10. I was (and am) being raised by my mom, since my dad was never really present in my life. She's done all she can to help me to grow into a strong respectful man. Around 2017, she met her current husband, my step-father Bill. He's a very strong independent man and a pretty good role model considering what he's been through. We moved out to Massachusetts, my step-dad's hometown, and we've lived here since. I like Boston. It's pretty calm despite the areas surrounding where I live.</p>
                <h2>About My Childhood</h2>
                <p>In my early childhood, everything was pretty usual. I was a very active kid, always outside playing with friends. I never really understood life. That was until the incident. The house next door caught on fire and the dog got stuck inside the house. A man ran in and saved the dog, but he had inhaled so much smoke he passed out and was coughing up black. That showed me that life isn't all puppies and rainbows. From then on I stayed away from everything. I didn't want to risk getting hurt. Then my mom met her husband in 2015. We moved from California to Boston in 2017. They got married officially the same year. All that led me to where I am today. </p>
                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>Throughout my life, I've picked up many hobbies and interests. My number 1 hobby has always been gaming though. I played my first game around the age of 3, when my brother taught me how to play Call of Duty on our Playstation 2. I also like to dance, rap, and do lots of different types of puzzles. My most notable feats in terms of puzzles are my solves of the 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 Rubik's Cubes. I also like to make videos occasionally for TikTok and YouTube. That one is more of a side hobby when I get really bored, but a hobby is a hobby in my eyes.</p>
