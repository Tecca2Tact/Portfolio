            <h2>A little background</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Zacariah, but my friends like to call me Zac or Tecca. The name Tecca comes from the name of a rapper people like to say I look similar to. I was born in Riverside California on July 6th, 2007 (16 years old), and was raised around the area until I was around 10. I was (and am) being raised by my mom, since my dad was never really present in my life. She's done all she can to help me to grow into a strong respectful man. Around 2017, she met her current husband, my step-father Bill. He's a very strong independent man and a pretty good role model considering what he's been through. We moved out to Massachusetts, my step-dad's hometown, and we've lived here since. I like Boston. It's pretty calm despite the areas surrounding where I live.</p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Throughout my life, I've picked up many hobbies and interests. My number 1 hobby has always been gaming though. I played my first game around the age of 3, when my brother taught me how to play Call of Duty on our Playstation 2. I also like to dance, rap, and do lots of different types of puzzles. My most notable feats in terms of puzzles are my solves of the 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 Rubik's Cubes. I also like to make videos occasionally for TikTok and YouTube. That one is more of a side hobby when I get really bored, but a hobby is a hobby in my eyes.</p>
