            <h2>A little background</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Zacariah, but my friends like to call me Zac or Tecca. The name Tecca comes from the name of a rapper people like to say I look similar to. I was born in Riverside California on July 6th, 2007 (16 years old), and was raised around the area until I was around 10. I was (and am) being raised by my mom, since my dad was never really present in my life. She's done all she can to help me to grow into a strong respectful man. Around 2017, she met her current husband, my step-father Bill. He's a very strong independent man and a pretty good role model considering what he's been through. We moved out to Massachusetts, my step-dad's hometown, and we've lived here since. I like Boston. It's pretty calm despite the areas surrounding where I live.</p>
